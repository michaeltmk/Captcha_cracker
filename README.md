# Captcha_cracker
A demonstration on cracking Captcha using CNN.

## Abstract
Captchas with 4 characters was scrapped on web.
In total there are 384 captcha images, 128 for training set, 128 for dev set, 128 for test set.
For each epoch, 128 more images are generated by captcha simulator and together 256 images are feeded into the model for training. The training will be stopped when the accuracy of dev set is above 0.9.

After training the model, it was tested on the test set and had very good result, the model is fine tuned.

Hence the dev set is moved to the training set. The model is trained again with same setting but a larger training set.
